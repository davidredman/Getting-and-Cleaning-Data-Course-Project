This respositoy contains the files to complete the final course peer graded assignment. The criteria for the projecty is 

    1. The submitted data set is tidy. 
    2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
    3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
    4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
    5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.


The files are based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 authored by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.  Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws.  The Url for the data set is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and a full description is avaialable a the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


This project contains four files: README.md, codebook.md, run_analysis.R, tidy_data.txt. Followings steps where followed:

    a. Download the dataset 
    b. Unzip the file to a project directory
    c. Load the dataset contain in the zip file into R
    d. Tidy the data
    e. Merge them
    f. Extract measurements on the mean and standard ddeviation for eane measurement
    g. Name the activities in the data with descriptive names
    h. Label the data set with descriptive variables names
    i. Create final tidy data set with the average of each variable activity and each subject
